PROJECT TITLE: Customer Relationship Management System USING AGILE METHODOLOGY

ABSTRACT
This project report describes the design and development of a CRM software system using Agile methodology. The system focuses on improving efficiency, usability, and scalability through iterative development, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
In today’s digital era, software systems play a vital role in automating business processes. The CRM software system is designed to replace traditional manual systems with an efficient digital solution. Agile methodology is adopted to ensure flexibility, faster delivery, and customer satisfaction.

CHAPTER 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional systems face issues such as poor data management, lack of transparency, slow processing, and difficulty in scaling. This project aims to overcome these challenges by implementing a structured and automated solution.

CHAPTER 3: OBJECTIVES
• To design a reliable and user-friendly system  
• To automate core operations  
• To ensure data accuracy and security  
• To apply Agile practices for continuous improvement  

CHAPTER 4: SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The scope includes requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and deployment. Future enhancements can be easily integrated due to the Agile nature of the project.

CHAPTER 5: AGILE METHODOLOGY
Agile methodology emphasizes iterative development through sprints. Each sprint includes planning, development, testing, and review. Daily stand-up meetings and sprint retrospectives help in identifying improvements.

CHAPTER 6: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Hardware Requirements:
• Processor: Intel i3 or above  
• RAM: 4 GB minimum  

Software Requirements:
• Operating System: Windows/Linux  
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
• Backend: Java/PHP  
• Database: MySQL  

CHAPTER 7: SYSTEM DESIGN
The system follows a modular architecture. Each module is developed and tested independently. UML diagrams such as use case, class, and sequence diagrams are used during design.

CHAPTER 8: IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation is carried out in multiple Agile sprints. Features are delivered incrementally, allowing early user feedback and timely changes.

CHAPTER 9: TESTING
Testing is performed at the end of each sprint. Functional testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing ensure system quality.

CHAPTER 10: ADVANTAGES
• Faster development  
• High adaptability  
• Better user satisfaction  
• Reduced risk  

CHAPTER 11: LIMITATIONS
• Requires active user involvement  
• Difficult to estimate total cost initially  

CHAPTER 12: FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
• Cloud integration  
• Mobile application support  
• Advanced analytics  

CHAPTER 13: CONCLUSION
The Customer Relationship Management System developed using Agile methodology successfully meets project objectives. Agile ensured flexibility, quality, and continuous improvement.
